# 🚀 DSA in C++  

This repository is my personal collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems solved in C++**.  
I use this space to practice and improve problem-solving skills, strengthen my understanding of core con cepts, and prepare for **coding interviews**.

## 📚 About  

- The repo contains **C++ implementations of DSA problems** from basics to advanced.  
- Problems are organized **topic-wise** (Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Trees, Graphs, etc.).  
- Each file focuses on **one problem/algorithm** with clear and optimized solutions.  
- Written in **C++17** and compiled using `g++`.  

This repo reflects my **daily coding practice and learning journey** in mastering DSA.
